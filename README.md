# RefinedAi ðŸŒŸ
A comprehensive Full-Stack application engineered to provide customers with advanced upscaling services through cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology.


# Overview ðŸš€

As of today, I am stil working on some final frontend touch ups / components of the website, however the main funtionalities behind the upscaler, image storage, user authentication, and all other backend features is all 100% complete.
(Scroll to Bottom to see a preview). The application should be completed and deloyed within 1-2 weeks, and when it is completed I will provide an actual overview of the application.

# Features ðŸŽˆ

- users can create accounts where each account has a profile picture, username, email, password, previously upscaled images, previously written reviews, and the amount of credits that they have (all stored through the backend)
- users can upscaled their images up to 4k using a real-esrgan super resolution model [StabilityAI Upscaler Api Documentation](https://github.com/Stability-AI/platform/tree/main)
- users can buy credits, which gives them the ability to upscale more images. These credits can be bought by either using paypal or stripe
- every time a user is logged in they are given a randomized token which is used for user authentication every time a request is made to the backend
- users can view the "collection", which is a collection of upscaled images all generated by other RefinedAI users
- users can both write reviews and see the reviews written by others
- users can view all of the information associated with their account and change their password at any time
- users can join an email list where they agree to recieve emails about the latest RefinedAI news
- users can view the featues of the real-esrgan super resolution model that RefinedAI uses


# Backend ðŸŒ™
![RefinedAi Backend Structure](https://github.com/cerredz/RefinedAi/assets/110927971/f3b76af9-4778-44e0-a1aa-e45d729e1e0b)

As an aspiring Software Engineer I feel like it is important to provide an explanation of my backend. The image above provides an overview of my backend structure, while below, I've outlined some key points about it.

- There is a collection of User documents. These documents store the information of a user's account (username, password, email, credits, etc). Everything a user does on the website that is tracked above is safely saved into the backend.

- There is a collection of Image documents. These image documents contain the id to the user that upscaled it, the path to the backend image storage that it is stored at, and some basic statistics about the actual image itself (width, height, size, etc).  Users have an array of image paths that correspond to the 'picturePath' field of images. This allows us to establish a direct link between a user's image paths and the paths of the images they've upscaled, effectively tracking which images belong to each user

- There is a collection of email documents. This one is pretty self-explanatory, a user signs up for the email list, their email is stored into the Email collection, and from their RefinedAi can send them emails about news, announcements, etc.

- There is a colletion of Review documents. These documents each have a desciption, star rating (1-5), and some user information associated with each review. The reason for linking a user's username and profile picture into each review not only so that we can store the reviews written by a user, but also it is so that it can be easily displayed on the frontend

- There is a collection of price documents. These documents are simple just different prices credit packages stored in the backend, so that the user cannot change the price on the credit package through the frontend.
