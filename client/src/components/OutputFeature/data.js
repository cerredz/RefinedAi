      "The maximum output resolution of an upscaled image using the Real-ESRGAN model that RefinedAI utilizes is 4194304 pixels. This equates to a 2048x2048 or 4096x1024 sized image.To put this into perspective, most devices and electronic displays, including common monitors and screens, have maximum resolutions that typically top out at 1920x1080 pixels. This means that upscaling an image to 2048x2048 pixels is not only incredibly detailed but also well beyond what is required for seamless and high-quality viewing on these devices.",

    subheading:
      "Although the output resolution of an image can reach 4k in height / width, not all images inputted into the upscaler will result in this sized resolution. However, you can upscale an image multiple times to counter this problem. You see, right now there is no technology available to upscale a 100x100 image to 2000x2000 in one go. Instead, you can upscale a 100x100 image to 200x200, then the 200x200 to 400x400, and so on. Unfortunately, this limitation can result in needing multiple credits to fully upscale a singular image, which is why we account for this in our credit packages.  ",
