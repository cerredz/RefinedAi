    heading: "What is Real-ESRGAN?",
    subheading: `Real-ESRGAN, short for "Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network," is an advanced deep learning technology in the field of image enhancement and super-resolution. It's designed to dramatically improve the quality and clarity of images, especially when scaling up their size. Real-ESRGAN leverages a powerful neural network architecture called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate high-resolution images from lower-resolution input.`,

    heading: "Why use Real-ESRGAN?",
    subheading: `What makes Real-ESRGAN particularly impressive is its ability to generate realistic and detailed images that look as if they were captured at a higher resolution originally. It's widely used in various applications, and  there are several compelling reasons why Real-ESRGAN stands out among other traditional upscaling techniques. Unlike traditional upscaling methods that merely interpolate pixel values, Real-ESRGAN utilizes a deep neural network to intelligently predict and generate missing high-resolution details. This results in significantly sharper and more visually pleasing images, making it an ideal choice for tasks where image quality matters.`,
